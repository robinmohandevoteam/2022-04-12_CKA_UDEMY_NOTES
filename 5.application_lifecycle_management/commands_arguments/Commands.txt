Docker:

$ docker run ubuntu

We see that the container starts and exits right away

$ docker ps

Once a task in a container is complete, the container stops. It will stay running as long as the processes/programs inside the container are alive.

In docker there is a default command.
For a nginx image it is: nginx
For mysql: mysqld
for a plain ubuntu image: bash

We can override the default command:

$ docker run ubuntu [command]
$ docker run ubuntu sleep 5

Entrypoint: specify the program when the container starts, without a argument. Argument must be specified when starting the container.

When you have an entrypoint and CMD specified:

FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD ["5"]

docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10
The 5 will be overwritten by the 10

The k8s command overwrites the docker ENTRYPOINT
the k8s args overwrites the docker CMD
