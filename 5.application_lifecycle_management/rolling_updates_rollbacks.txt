rollout command:

kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment

Deployment Strategies:

recreate: all pods are deleted and then recreated: in the mean time the application is down.

Rolling Update: Pods are deleted and recreated one by one: application does not go down.

Rolling Update = default deployment strategy.

Two ways to do the deployment:
- kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yml (with the image changed in the YAML to a newer version)
- kubectl set image deployument/myapp-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1

In a upgrade, k8s creates a new replicaset in the Deployment: The old and the new one.

To reverse the rollout/make a rollback:

kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment

We can see this all happening when we do:
kubectl get replicasets
