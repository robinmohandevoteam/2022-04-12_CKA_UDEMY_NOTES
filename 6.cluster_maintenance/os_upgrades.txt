operating system upgrade:

When the node is down for more than 5 minutes, the pods on the node are terminated.
In case of the pods being part of a ReplicaSet, they're rescheduled on other nodes.

This time, is known as pod-eviction-timeout

$ kube-controller-manager --pod-eviction-timemout=5m0s
So it will take 5 minutes of the node being down before k8s considers the node being dead.
In case that the pod comes back online after the pod-eviction-timeout, the pod will be blank (no nodes)

Drain a node: move pods to other nodes in the cluster. The node has become unscheduleable and brings the node down.
$ kubectl drain node-1

Often draining nodes gives an error because there are nodes from a daemonset present. Add the following
--ignore-daemonsets
$ kubectl drain node-1 --ignore-daemonsets

To make the node available for scheduling, uncordon the node.
$ kubectl uncordon node-1

corden a node: make the node unscheduleable.
$ kubectl cordon node-1

Difference between cordon and drain:
drain terminates the node and moves the pods to other nodes.
cordon makes the node unscheduleable (does not terminate the node and pods are not moved). New pods are not scheduled on that node.
