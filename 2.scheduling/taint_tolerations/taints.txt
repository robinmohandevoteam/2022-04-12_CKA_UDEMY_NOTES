to add a taint to a node:

kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<taint-effect>
kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule

to untaint a node use the same command but add a - at the end of the command:
kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule-

Keep in mind that the controlplane/master node has a taint by default that works a bit differently.
