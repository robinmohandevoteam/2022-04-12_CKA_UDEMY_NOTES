Resource Requests: The computing resources the pod asks from a node/ requirements from the pod to be placed on a node:
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk

When there is no node available with sufficient resources, the pod will end up in a pending state.

1 CPU =
- 1 AWS vCPU
- 1 GCP Core
- 1 Azure Core
- 1 Hyperthread

CPU can be as low as 0.1 CPU ( = 100m)

Memory:

1 G (Gigabyte) = 1,000,000,000 bytes
1 M (Megabyte) = 1,000,000 bytes
1 K (Kilobyte) = 1,000 bytes

1 Gi (Gibibyte) = 1,073,741,824 bytes
1 Mi (Mebibyte) = 1,048,576 bytes
1 Ki (Kibibyte) = 1,024 bytes

Limits (how much can the pod use from the node):

defaults for limits can be set in a LimitRange Resource
This LimitRange is bound to a NameSpace.
