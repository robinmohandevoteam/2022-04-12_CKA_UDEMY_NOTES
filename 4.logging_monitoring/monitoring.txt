We want to know things on different levels:
- node
- pod

heapster was one of the first monitoring service -> Now became Metrics Server
You can have 1 Metrics Server per k8s cluster.
- In-memory

How are metrics generated:
Kubelet contains cAdvisor:
Exposes metrics to the Kubelet API

To enable Metrics Server on minikube:
minikube addons enable metrics-server

for other k8s servers:
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server.git
kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/

View:

kubectl top node
kubectl top pod
