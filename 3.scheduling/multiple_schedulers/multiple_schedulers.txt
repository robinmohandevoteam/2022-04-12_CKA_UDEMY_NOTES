We can add a scheduler with our own conditions
Our k8s cluster can have multiple schedulers at the same time.

When creating a pod, we can specify which scheduler needs to be used to schedule the pod.

We have seen how to download the scheduler as a binary.
When we do this and we have not defined a name, the defuault name will be:
--scheduler-name=default-scheduler

When you make your own scheduler:
--scheduler-name=my-custom-scheduler

We can copy the default scheduler(Pod) and add the --scheduler-name to the -command block

In the pod definition file, we add a new key/value under spec:

schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler
