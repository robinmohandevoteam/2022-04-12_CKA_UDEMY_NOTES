A node can live on its own in the sea: it's not part of a cluster and there is no master node.
These pods are called Static Pods and are managed by their own captain: kubelet.
You can specify manifest files to run pods. (no other k8s resources or objects)
If you remove these files, the pod will be deleted automatically.
The kubelet will try to restart the pod when the pod is down.

The path of thhe manifests folder is specified as followed in kubelet.service:
--pod-mainifest-path=/etc/Kubernetes/manifests

You could also make use of a kubeconfig file:

kubeconfig.yaml:
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests

kubelet.service:
--config=kubeconfig.yaml

If we want to see the process of this static pod. We cannot use kubectl. We should use docker ps.
The  kube-apiservice is not there since this is part of the master node.

But the master node is aware of static pods and can list them. You can only view this pod, but cannot edit or delete it.

Why would we want to use static pods?
For creating master nodes and to install the masterplane components ourselves.
