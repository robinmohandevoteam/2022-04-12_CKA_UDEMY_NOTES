APi Groups in k8s

What is the k8s API?

If we want to check the version of our cluster, we can access the API:
    $ curl https://kube-master:6443/version (port 6443 is the default port)

If we want to get the pods we can do:
    $ curl https://kube-master:6443/api/v1/pods

The k8s api consists of multiple subgroups:
    - /version
        show the version of the cluster
    - /api
    - /apis
    - /logs
        for intergrated third party logging applications
    - /metrics
        helps to monitor the cluster
    - /healthz
        help to monitor the cluster


info about apis is divided in two subgroups:
    - /api: core group
        - all the core functionalies exist here: /v1
            - namespaces
            - pods
            - rc
            - configmaps
            - services
            - etc etc etc
    - /apis named group
        - are more organized
        - newer features are and will be placed in this named group
            - /apps
                /v1
                    deployments
            - /extensions
            - /networking.k8s.io
                /v1
                    /networkpolicies
            - /storage.k8s.io
            - /authentication.k8s.io
            - /certificates.k8s.io

Each resource has actions you can do with these resources, trese are known as verbs:
    - list
    - get
    - create
    - delete
    - update
    - watch

We can show this in our apicluster:
    $ curl http://localhost:6443 -k

We can show the supported resources:
    $ cutl http://localhost:6443/apid -k | grep 'name'

If we were to acces the api with a curl, we are most likely denied access as we haven't specified any authentication mechanisms.
We have to specify our certificates details:
    $ curl http://localhost:6443 -k
    --key admin.key
    --cert admin.crt
    --cacert ca.crt

Alternatively, we can use a kubectl proxy client:
    $kubectl proxy

This launches a proxyserver on port 8001. This way we don't have to specify our certification details.

Two terms that kind of sound the same:
- kube proxy
    Used to enable connectivity between pods and services accross diffrent nodes in the cluster.
- kubectl proxy
    An HTTP created by kubectl utility to access the Kube API server.
