kube-apiserver is at the center of everything in cluster.
This is the first line of defence

We have to decicde two things:
- Who can access the cluster?
    - Files - Username and Passwords
    - Files - Username and Tokens
    - Certificates
    - External Authentication providers = LDAP
    - Service Accounts (for machines)
- What can they do in the cluster?
    - RBAC Authorization
    - ABAC Authorization
    - Node Authorization
    - Webhook Mode

All the communication between the master node components (ETCD Cluster, Kubelet, Kube Controller Manager, Kuve scheduler, Kube Proxy) is secured using TLS encryption.

Communication between applications within the cluster:
By default, all the pods can acces other pods in the cluster.
We can resrtict this using Network Policies.
