Authorization

Why do we need authorization?
Admins have several rights for operations.

We don't want the developers and bots having the same rights as the admins.

different authorization methods:
- Node
    The kubelet accesses and communicates with the Kube API
    Everything with the name 'system:node:node01' uses the Node authorization method.
- ABAC (Attribute Based Athorization Control)
    Users are associated with a set of rules
    Using a policy file created in JSON format.
- RBAC
    Instead od associate a set of permissions to a user, we provide a user with a role.
- Webhook
    When we want to outsource the authorization process (e.g. to Open Policy Agent)
    Kube API server can make a call to the Agent with information about the user.

There are two more modes in addition to this:
    - Always allow: Allows everybody and everything (this is the default)
    - Always deny: Denies everynody and everything

Authorization mode:
--authorization-mode=Node, RBAC, Webhook
Authorization will go according to this sequence.
