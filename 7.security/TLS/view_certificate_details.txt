When you set up a k8s cluster the hard way, you have to set all the certificates yourself. find them at:
    $ cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service

When you use kubeadm, Find them at:
    $ cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
Look for the path for the certificates you want to see, then use the following command to show:
    $ openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout

---

Inspect Service Logs, k8s the hard way:
    $ journalctl -u etcd.service -l

Inspect Logs, kubeadm:
    $ kubectl logs etcd-master

Sometimes we have to go one level deeper to docker to get the logs:
    1. check the running proccesses:
        $ docker ps -a
    2. check the logs:
        $ docker logs 87fc
