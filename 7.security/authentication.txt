There are different users accessing the cluster:
- Admins
- Developers
- Bots
- Application End users

Admins and Developers are users.
Bots make use of Service Accounts

Users cannot be create in a cluster by using kubectl
But serviceaccounts can be created in a cluster:
    $ kubectl create serviceaccount sa1
    $ kubectl get serviceaccount

All user access is managed by the kube-apiserver
The kube-apiserver:
1. Authenticate the user
2. Processes the request

How does the kube-apiserver authenticate?
    - Static Password File
    - Static Token File
    - Certificates
    - Identity Services

Static Password File:
Uses a csv file:
password,username,userid

user-details.csv
password123,user1, u0001
password123,user2, u0002
password123,user3, u0003

You can pass this file as an option to the kube-apiserver:

kube-apiserver.service
--basic-auth-file=user-details.csv
restart the kube-apiserver
