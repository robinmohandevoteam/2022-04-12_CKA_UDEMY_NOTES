Network Policies

There are two types of traffic:
    - ingress: the right to enter a property (pod)
    - engress: the right to exit a property (pod)
This is the direction of the traffic

By default traffic betweens pods is allowed.

We implement a network policy to prevent two pods communicating with each other.

A network policy is an object and is placed on a pod.
We select the pods with labels and selectors.
