Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
    used to make PV available to a node.

PV and PVC are two different objects in k8s.

k8s binds the PVC and to a PV accoring to the requirements.
Every PVC is bound to a PV.
k8s checks:
    - Sufficient Capacity
    - Access Mode
    - Volume Modes
    - Storage Class

If there are multiple suitable PVs available, we can still specify a specifig PV with labels and selectors.

A smaller claim may get bound to a larger volume in case all the criteria matches and there is no better option.

PVC to PV is a 1 to 1 relationship:
    One PVC per PV

The PVC will remain in a pending state when no PV is available until one in available.
