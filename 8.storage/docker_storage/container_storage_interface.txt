In the past, k8s used only the docker container runtime


Container Runtime Interface (CRI):
    How does k8s communicate with container runtimes like:
        - Docker
        - rkt
        - cri-o

So a future new container runtime must follow the CRI standards.

Container Network Interface (CNI):
    How does k8s communicate with networking renders like:
        - weaveworks
        - flannel
        - cilium

Container Storage Interface (CSI):
    How does k8s communicate with storage solutions as:
        - Portworx
        - Amazon EBS
        - Dell EMC
        - GlusterFS
        - You can even write your own drivers

CSI is not a k8s specific standard, it's meant to be a universal standard.
    Current technologies supports CSI:
        - k8s
        - CloudFoundry
        - Apache Mesos
