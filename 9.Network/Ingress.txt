k8s doesn't have a ingress controller by default.
You must deploy one yourself.
We can use Nginx.

Nginx is installed as a deployment on the clutster (see deployment)
We must also make a ConfigMap for storing information:
    - err-log-path
    - keep-alive
    - ssl-protocols

We then need a nodeport service to expose the ingress.

We then make a service account.
